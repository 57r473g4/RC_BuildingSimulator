# Grasshopper Module for 5R1C model 

## Aims

This branch is dedicated to adapting the 5R1C model into a Grasshopper module as part of the A/S HIVE project. Such a module would allow single-zone building simulations to be performed completely within the Grasshopper environment, providing a simpler alternative to Honeybee.

The target users are architects familiar with Grasshopper and Ladybug tools, who do not have experience in building simulation.
