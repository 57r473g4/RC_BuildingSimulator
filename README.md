# RC_BuildingSimulator

Simulates the energy balance of a single zone room based on an RC model. This project is still under development

## Models Available

There are two models available

`3R1C_Old_Simulator`: The first itteration which uses PID control 

`5R1C_ISO_Simulator`: A simulation engine based off ISO 13790 Standards
